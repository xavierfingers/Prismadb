* Prisma DB Example
This is a very simple Prisma DB without a .env with Neon API key.
Steps: Number 1: sign up for Neon
[https://neon.tech]
Number 2: add credentials to .env
Number 3: run npm install && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push
When this site runs, it will send data to the database you configured every time you visit.
Thanks!!
